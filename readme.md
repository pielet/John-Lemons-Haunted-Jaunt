John Lemon is put at one end of a haunting room. He needs your help to find the way out after collecting all three stars on the map. Remember not to be spotted by the ~~cute~~ walking ghosts and demon statues, or else you will lose the game!

* `1`, `2`, and `3` to switch viewports (`1` for third-person, `2` for first-person, and `3` for side-scrolling)
